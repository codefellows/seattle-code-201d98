## Problem Domain

The focus group results have been collected and the Odd Duck Products team is ready to go into production! The results were so positive that the marketing team would also like to make these products available for online purchase. Your task is to bring functionality to an order form page and a shopping cart page.

The marketing team wants the site deployed for testing in a few hours. To give you an idea of what they are looking for, the team has added some `TODO` tasks throughout the JavaScript files. They do not have any preferences for styling, so use your best judgment when filling in the `style.css` file. However, they refuse to budge on the structure of the website and have asked that you *DO NOT* modify the HTML files in any way.

Your senior dev was able to meet with you and your teammate for few minutes to get you oriented to the code base. She was able to give you the following pointers, before getting pulled into a code review for another feature.

1. There are multiple .js files
1. `cart.js` is used on the cart page and `catalog.js` is used on the page with the form
1. The `app.js` file carries some global definitions that the others will reference, and is loaded into both pages
1. You will encounter and need to deal with new types of form element, `<select>` and `<option>`
1. You will need to reference elements without IDs

## Instructions

This is a pair programming lab. One person from the pair will create a new repo using this [template repository](https://github.com/codefellows/201-lab-14).

Add the other person as a collaborator. That means that both of you will have privileges to push and merge to that repo.

Fill in the necessary code in the JavaScript and CSS files, but **do not modify the HTML files in any way**.

Your `index.html` is an order form for customers for the Odd Duck Products.

Your `cart.html` page will display the Odd Duck Products orders on a typical shopping cart checkout page.

### Tips

Here are some things to think about as you go plan out the lab for today:

- You'll need to use local storage to share data between the two HTML pages.
- You and your partner should plan out how you want to collaboratively attack the problem with regards to pair programming. It's up to you how the details are managed, but make sure each partner makes contributions in both CSS and JS files.
- Complete the `TODO` items in the order that works best for you.
- Plan on some time researching `<select>`,`<option>`, and how to select elements by tag.

### In a nutshell

- Complete all `TODO` items in the JavaScript files.
- Give the app some style.
- Deploy the app.
- Do ****NOT**** modify the html files.
