# TODO List for Cookie Stand

## Todo

<!-- project -->
- [ ] Create low-fidelity wireframe
- [ ] create high-fidelity wireframe
- [ ] Design client-facing page
- [ ] create sales.html

<!-- index.html  -->
- [x] Add image of the provided fish
- [x] A custom sans-serif Google Font for use in heading tags (<h# />)
- [x] A specified standard sans-serif web font for sales data (such as Arial, Verdana, or Helvetica).
- [x] A specified standard serif web font for text (such as Georgia, Times).
- [x] Specified different font colors for all three font uses.
- [ ] A background color for the default page background (make sure font colors have good contrast and are readable on this background).
- [ ] A different background color for elements such boxes and tables (so make sure the font colors contrast against this well, too!).
- [ ] Anything else you’d like to add related to style. But remember: simplicity, clarity, and consistency are good things in design.
- [ ] Be thoughtful about layout and overall organization of the page.
- [ ] Run a Lighthouse Accessibility report. In this module, push to achieve a score between 65-80. Add the screenshot of your score to your README.md.
- [ ] Include all of the typical stuff that you’ll find on the home page of a business: locations, hours, contact information, some text about how awesome the business is, etc. Be creative, and again, think about what is meaningful to a typical end user.

<!-- javascript -->
- [ ] Create JS Object literal for each shop
    > Each location will be responsible for generating sales data and providing output on an html document

The Javascript file should be able to perform the following: (Due 3/14/23)

- [ ] Store the min/max hourly customers, and the average cookies per customer, in object properties.
- [ ] Use a method of that object to generate a random number of customers per hour.
    > [Reading for Math.random()](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Math/random)
- [ ] Calculate and store the simulated amounts of cookies purchased for each hour at each location using average cookies purchased and the random number of customers generated.
- [ ] Store the results for each location in a separate array… perhaps as a property of the object representing that location.
- [ ] Display the values of each array as unordered lists in the browser.
- [ ] Calculating the sum of these hourly totals; your output for each location should look like this:

``` text
Seattle

6am: 16 cookies
7am: 20 cookies
8am: 35 cookies
9am: 48 cookies
10am: 56 cookies
11am: 77 cookies
12pm: 93 cookies
1pm: 144 cookies
2pm: 119 cookies
3pm: 84 cookies
4pm: 61 cookies
5pm: 23 cookies
6pm: 42 cookies
7pm: 57 cookies
Total: 875 cookies
```

- [ ]Display the lists on sales.html. We will be adding features to this application and working with its layout in the upcoming labs.  
Here are the starting numbers  

``` javascript

let seattle = {
  'minCust': 23,
  'maxCust': 65,
  'avgCookieSale': 6.3
}

let Tokyo = {
  'minCust': 3,
  'maxCust': 24,
  'avgCookieSale': 1.2
}

let Dubai = {
  'minCust': 11,
  'maxCust': 38,
  'avgCookieSale': 3.7
}

let Paris = {
  'minCust': 20,
  'maxCust':38,
  'avgCookieSale': 2.3
}

let Lima = {
  'minCust': 2,
  'maxCust': 16,
  'avgCookieSale': 4.6
}

```

> These numbers are simply Pat’s estimates for now, but eventually, once there has been some history collected that provides more accurate numbers, we’ll want the ability to update these numbers for each location, and to add/remove locations. But we’ll not build all of that today. Make sure to make each location is its own JavaScript object.
